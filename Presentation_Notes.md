# Presentation Notes

You can practice on your own using just these couple of resources:

[CommonMark Interactive Tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)

[CommonMark Markdown Cheatsheet](https://commonmark.org/help/)

If you want get started making Markdown formatted docs:

[https://dillinger.io/](https://dillinger.io/) - Dillinger (very basic Markdown editor)

[https://stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io) - StackEdit (more advanced Markdown Editor)

Here's the tool I used to create the slide deck used for the meeting in Markdown:

### Additional Information

Recently at MS Ignite 2020, one of the PowerShell talks given about PowerShell 7.1 mentions Visual Studio Code .NET Notebooks. These notebooks are similar to Jupyter Notebooks. 
You guessed it, Markdown is used and much of what you've learned during this presentation will be useful to use these new ways of documenting code and teaching! Keep watching the [PowerShell Team Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/) for updates.

Remember, there are tons of uses for Markdown. It's the formatting language of the Internet, and it's everywhere.
